# fortinet-drawio
A set of Fortinet icons from official website https://icons.fortinet.com to be imported on https://draw.io

I will attempt to maintain and track all new icons that are introduced and merge back into this repository when I notice changes.

# How to use it:

On Draw.IO, go to **File > Open Library From > URL** and paste the following URL:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrismegyeri/fortinet-drawio/refs/heads/main/Fortinet.xml`

Or if using the Web Version of DrawIO please paste in the following within your configuration XML for DrawIO
